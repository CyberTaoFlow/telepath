* Introduction:
  =============

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. 
It can represent integer, real number, string, an ordered sequence of 
value, and a collection of name/value pairs.

JsonCpp (http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/) is a simple API to manipulate 
JSON value, handle serialization and unserialization to string.

It can also preserve existing comment in unserialization/serialization steps,
making it a convenient format to store user input files.

Unserialization parsing is user friendly and provides precise error reports.
